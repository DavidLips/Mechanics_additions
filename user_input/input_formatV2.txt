//STRUCTURES
let's simulate <1FAT>
together with this guy <3INS>

//FORCES
apply a brownian force at <300>K

//LINEAR ABSOLUTE POSITION CONSTRAINTS
constrain <1FAT> in direction <[0,0,1]> at magnitude <0>
constrain <1FAT> in direction <[0,1,0]> at magnitude <0>

//ANGULAR ABSOLUTE POSITION CONSTRAINTS
constrain <1FAT> along axis <[1,0,0]> at angle <-90>

//RELATIVE POSITION CONSTRAINTs (if #structures > 1)
keep a distance of <10> beteween <1FAT> and <3INS>

//LINKER
test linkers of length <7, 10, 13> between <1FAT> <N-terminal> and <3INS> <C-terminal>

//ANALYTE
analyse the <distance> between <1FAT> and <3INS> 



//END
// Let's stop here for now (other test cases below)
let's analyse the <position> of <1FAT> at an offset of <[0,0,0]> from its center of mass
let's analyse the <distance> between <1FAT> and <[0,0,0]>


let's just return a constant <scalar> value of <0.5>


let's analyse the <distance> between <1FAT> and <[1,1,1]> 
let's analyse the <distance> between <1FAT> and <3INS> 

let's just analyse the size of the current <timestep>


let's just return a constant <vector> value of <[1,0,0]>

//CONDITION (applies to analyte)
if the <distance> between <1FAT> and <3INS> is less than <0.5>
